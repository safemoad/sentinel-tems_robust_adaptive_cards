This repo is designed to serve as a template to develop robust adaptive Microsoft Teams cards, 
automated through Power Automate, to support your security operations in Microsoft Sentinel.  
These cards provide incident summary, pivot hyperlinks, incident closure functionality, and 
closure summary.

Due to the nature of Power Automate integrations, there are various account and communication 
settings that will need to be tailored for your implementation.  All variables are inserted as 
placeholders in the following format:  <<<<<VARIABLE-NAME-HERE>>>>>.
